        <p class="lead mb-4"> My goal in art and subject to my portfolio is to express what is not see, especially in the music world.It‚Äôs very difficult to believe that someone with remarkable singing and dancing talent, a dreamy complexion, and a dazzling smile can be thinking about committing suicide. Artists in the K-pop industry often give such illusions of being a flawless idol. Thus recognizing their mental and physical struggles is nearly impossible to detect until it‚Äôs too late. According to World of Buzz Entertainment Journalist Renushara, in recent years, ‚Äúseven K-pop stars have committed suicide due to depression‚Äù (Shara 5). The death of world-renowned singing celebrities, such as Shinee‚Äôs Kim Jonghyun in 2019, has recently shed light on the K-pop industry‚Äôs dark and pressuring perfectionistic requirements of their stars.  Many celebrities are pushed to do what seems inevitable due to the music company‚Äôs cutthroat weight and beauty requirements,  excessive practice hours, and crippling Korean stigma against mental health. 

	It is not rare to hear from K-pop group interviews of stars having to train over 12 hours a day with little to no sustenance. As a former trainee Eudioas describes it, working under a Korean music company is physically and mentally taxing: ‚Äú [We] were encouraged to starve ourselves ... forced to sleep on wooden floors, and after 18-hour days of work would often pass out from exhaustion‚Äù (Independent 3). These experiences of strict and unhealthy obligations are similar to those described by former F(x) group member Amber Liu. In an interview with Daily Mail, she details the intense pressure of fitting into a music company‚Äôs idyllic image: ‚Äú ‚ÄòIf you aren't under a certain weight, you can definitely get cut...You're told what to do, what to say‚Ä¶[And] the stigma against mental health is just so strong‚Äô ‚Äù (Dailymail 3). It is simply wrong and unfair when considering the working conditions teen trainees and artists are put through in order to have a chance at stardom. A company‚Äôs stringent demands also limit the development of one‚Äôs unique qualities, especially when one has yet to discover their personality. The constant surveillance and overworking conditions prohibit a healthy balance of individualized thinking and physical recovery that in turn lead artists towards a self -destructive path.     

The first step to fixing these harmful and unnecessary requirements is with spreading awareness about their effects. As many fans know, social media is the best way to directly connect and interact with their favorite groups. On social platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, are a plethora of the targeted audience needed to gain motion in a social media campaign aimed to promote the wellness of K-pop artists. The freedom to live a realistic and authentic life, while pursuing a musical career, relies on being able to communicate a key vision- the promulgation of a singer‚Äôs overall health. That goal includes the reduction of practice hours, removal of weight qualifications, and encouraging mental well being. By first setting small yet clear campaign goals, creating buyer personas to research extensive details on public demand, choosing a social media platform, one is able to empower others to take personal responsibility to help break overbearing music industry perfectionistic demands(Chaffey 5).  

However, with any social project, there are certain structural obstacles to overcome before any actual change. One of which is setting the first stepping stone of cutting through media noise.  In order to generate the urgency of this ongoing celebrity crisis and appeal to an uninformed public, ‚Äú [a] campaign has to have a single, simple message at its core...where your [audience] should never be trying to figure out what the point of your campaign is‚Äù(Chaffy 9). Knowing this, a  message is only as good as it is conveyed. Therefore developing a unique and organized movement or choosing a proper social media platform to represent the overbearing requirements in the Korean music industry, proves to be quite difficult. 

Another hurdle that social campaigning brings would be dealing with a potential lack of public engagement. As popular crowdfunding platform Gofundme states, ‚Äúmessaging isn‚Äôt ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô when it comes to supporter engagement. When you‚Äôre talking to your supporters, you want to identify where they are at in the [campaigning] process‚Äù(Gofundme 7). The tailoring of a universal message of viewing K-pop stars as, first, flawed people may not align with certain audience perspectives. Especially when considering the stigma around mental health awareness in South Korea - there may be opposition to even consider the implications of perfectionism. According to Modern Media journalist James Walkins, ‚Äú This is in part because of stigma: 78 percent of elderly Koreans think depression means a person is weak compared to the 10 percent in the US‚Äù(Ozy 3).  The social norm in viewing mental issues as a defect not only discourages one‚Äôs will to be open to mental issues but also impedes others from recognizing their own health needs.  Without the public‚Äôs consensus on the fallacy of the impeccable idol, the chain cycle of suicide continues.
	In spite of these obstacles,  K-pop fandom‚Äôs history is nothing short of a miracle worker.  In previous years, global audiences have seen the enormous impact left by fandom justice warriors and their dedication to protecting the artists they adore. For instance, when the popular boy band BTS was not given recognition for helping bring singer Jason Derulo to the Billboard Top 100 fans went ballistic on Twitter: ‚Äú This led to the hashtag #JasonDeruloIsOverParty trending on [the platform]... [Such backlash] led Jason to share the same video on Twitter and tag the K-pop band‚Äù (Desk 6). As seen in the small case of artist recognition rights, fans are fervent when confronted with even the slightest mistreatment of their idols. Also in consideration of the masses of passionate Korean pop fans on social media, an organized campaign would have enough following to gain a voice. This audience goes far from the borders of Korea and has even expanded into global activist movements, ‚Äúusing Twitter as a home base.. [Devotees] have flooded would-be white supremacist hashtags, while also announcing that they had matched a $1 million donation from BTS for Black Lives Matter groups‚Äù(NY times 4). Social media, especially Twitter, serves as the ideal soapbox for fans to address major issues that involve beloved groups. Overall, the loyalty of fandoms grouped with media organizations creates bold and unprecedented movements that change authority figures‚Äô treatment towards K-Pop celebrities. 

 With a mission as dire as changing work conditions for Korean artists to avoid the path of self-harm, there must be a definite call that empowers and involves supporters in the process. Although most Koreans do not believe in the need for mental health services- there is a silver lining in tragedy: ‚Äú [K-pop deaths have] spurred numerous conversations about the state of mental health care in South Korea and within its entertainment industry.. stars had become more open with their struggles ..several even taking hiatuses from the industry‚Äù (Billboard 3).With the rise of public supporters of mental health in Korea , more doors open towards open communication about the devastating  realities of social perfectionism. 

        Rather than just voicing their concerns for better treatment of their idols, a famous k-pop group ,Winner, fan club goes on to take action. In response to the Korean company YG repeatedly using Winner‚Äôs branding as bait to gain profit from supposed ‚Äúcomeback‚Äù merchandise, fans resorted to boycotting : ‚ÄúWe are going to boycott WINNER‚Äôs DVD (2015 WWIC in Seoul) since [music company] ]YG has acted on its own and delayed WINNER‚Äôs comeback‚Äù(Soompi 2). The lack of consideration towards the group‚Äôs potential desire and extenuous efforts towards getting on the stage is a valid reason to defy the companies marketing tactics. It is also understandable to be frustrated, especially when companies tend to value money over the best wishes of its audience. However, as Upenn professor of marketing Americus Reed puts it,‚Äú if the aim is to hurt company sales, boycotts rarely succeed. But if the aim is to undermine companies that stand in the way of a movement, there is a greater chance that a boycott may tarnish a brand‚Äù (Reed 1). There are many ways to confront an issue that goes against one‚Äôs values, but all come to hope of reaching a similar goal - change. As much as it is idyllic to have immediate results , the loss of one‚Äô album collection will do little to exert pressure on social issues. The belittlement of artist choice and perfect obedience to company demands can still continue if without the supplement aid of impactful and uniting words. Both the combination of utilizing social media platforms and direct action can expose the abuses of excessive conditions of puppeteering companies .
